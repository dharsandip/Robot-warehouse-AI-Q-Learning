This project is about solving movements of a Robot in a Large Warehouse of a Business using AI (Q-Learning). Layout of the warehouse (maze) with different locations (A->Z) where various products are stored are shown in the image (Maze-Warehouse.jfif). Rewards are specified for the different points based on the locations and orientations. Goal for the robot is to reach ending location or priority location from the starting location by the shortest or optimal route. Another goal is to customize the route by specifying some intermediate important location through which robot should move and reach the final destination.
